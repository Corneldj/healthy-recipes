- **Prep time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook time:** 20 minutes
- **Servings:** 1

## Ingredients

- 1 small baby barramundi, cleaned
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 1 long red chilli, deseeded and finely sliced
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 1 tbsp ginger, grated
- 1/2 lime, sliced into wedges
- 1 tsp sesame seeds
- Fresh coriander to serve

## Instructions

1.  Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2.  Make sure your barramundi is cleaned and descaled.
3.  Score the fish on both sides with a sharp knife. This helps the flavors to penetrate the fish.
4.  In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, fish sauce, lime juice, chilli, garlic, and ginger to create the marinade.
5.  Place the fish on a lined baking tray and pour the marinade over it. Use a spoon to ensure the fish is evenly coated.
6.  Arrange the lime wedges over the top of the fish and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
7.  Bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
8.  Garnish with fresh coriander before serving.
